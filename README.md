# Junior Frontend Developer

I'm motivated Junior Frontend Developer focused on building responsive and mobile-first web applications with **React** and **Next.js**. Actively developing practical skills through hands-on practice and continuous learning.

Built user interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**, following modern frontend best practices. Worked with API integration, Git, and responsive layouts, paying attention to clean code and usability. Experienced in adapting projects using a mobile-first approach and improving UI for different screen sizes.

Currently looking for a Junior Frontend Developer position where I can contribute to real products, grow professionally, and strengthen my skills in a collaborative team environment.
